Hey there! Thanks for reviewing my url shortener project, ShortenIt! There are a few things you should know to be able to run this project correctly.

1. There are 4 commands you can use to run the project: 
    - 'make setup'
    - 'make run-client'
    - 'make run-server'
    - 'make test'

2. Because the client is running via node-served webpack, you will need to run both the client and server separately (in two separate processes). 
The client runs on port 3000 and the server on port 5001.

3. 'make setup' will install both yarn and the dotnet tools (needed to test and run the server code) and restore node_modules. Make sure to run this before you run 'make run-client' or 'make run-server'

4. 'make test' will run both client side (react-testing-library / jest) and server side (XUnit) unit tests. 
There are no integration tests for this project, but given the chance I would have implemented those using cypress.

5. The database is a sqlite db. I am using an EntityFramework ORM connection to access and modify the records in the db. It is lightweight and portable,
which is why I chose to use it for this project. However, in a production environment I would have chosen to use something more robust like Microsoft SQL Server or MySQL.
